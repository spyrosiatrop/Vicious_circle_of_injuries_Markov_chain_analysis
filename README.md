This repository contains the code written and used for the study "The vicious circle of injuries...etc" by Edouard and Iatropoulos....

The complete analysis code is provide in the file markov_chains_functions.

Since sharing the data used for this study would violate the rules of data sharing of the original PREVATHLE randomised clinical trial, we uploaded a simulation dataset with fake data, to showcase the format that data should be provided in the functions and to provide a strating point for the reader to see how the functions work.

Some examples of how the functions were used for each objective of the study are presented in the files Objective_one and Objective_two
